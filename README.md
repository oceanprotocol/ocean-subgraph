## üèÑ Get Started

This subgraph is deployed for all networks the Ocean Protocol contracts are deployed to:

- [subgraph.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com)
- [subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com)
- [subgraph.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com)

## üß∂ Example Queries

**All pools**

```graphql
{
  pools(orderBy: oceanReserve, orderDirection: desc) {
    consumePrice
    datatokenReserve
    oceanReserve
    spotPrice
    swapFee
    transactionCount
  }
}
```

**All datatokens**

```graphql
{
  datatokens {
    address
    symbol
    name
    cap
    supply
    publisher
    holderCount
  }
}
```

**All pool transactions for a user**

```graphql
{
  poolTransactions(
    orderBy: timestamp
    where: { userAddressStr: $userAddress }
  ) {
    poolAddressStr
  }
}
```

## ü¶ë Development

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

- Install/run the Graph: `https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start`

  - You can skip running ganache-cli and connect directly to `mainnet` using Infura

```bash
git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/
cd graph-node/docker
./setup.sh
# Update this line in the `docker-compose.yml` file with your Infura ProjectId
#   ethereum: 'mainnet:https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/INFURA_PROJECT_ID'
docker-compose up
```

Note: making contract calls using Infura fails with `missing trie node` errors. The fix requires editing `ethereum_adapter.rs` line 434 to use the latest block instead of a specific block number. Replace: `web3.eth().call(req, Some(block_id)).then(|result| {` with `web3.eth().call(req, Some(BlockNumber::Latest.into())).then(|result| {`

To run the graph-node with this fix it must be run from source.

First, delete the `graph-node` container from the `docker-compose.yml` file
then run `docker-compose up` to get the postgresql and ipfs services running.

Now you can build and run the graph-node from source

```
cargo run -p graph-node --release > graphnode.log --
  --postgres-url postgres://graph-node:let-me-in@localhost:5432/graph-node
  --ethereum-rpc mainnet:https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/INFURA_PROJECT_ID
  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001
```

- Once the graph node is ready, do the following to deploy the ocean-subgraph to the local graph-node

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/
cd ocean-subgraph
npm i
npm run codegen
npm run create:local
npm run deploy:local
```

- You can edit the event handler code and then run `npm run deploy:local`
  - Running deploy will fail if the code has no changes
  - Sometimes deploy will fail no matter what, in this case:
    - Stop the docker-compose run (`docker-compose down`)
    - Delete the `ipfs` and `postgres` folders in `graph-node/docker/data`
    - Restart docker-compose
    - Run `npm run create:local` to create the ocean-subgraph
    - Run `npm run deploy:local` to deploy the ocean-subgraph

## ‚ú® Code Style

For linting and auto-formatting you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# lint all js with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all js & css with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's machine with release scripts. From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger Travis to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)
