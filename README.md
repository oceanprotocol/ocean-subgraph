## üèÑ Get Started

This subgraph is deployed under `/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/` namespace for all networks the Ocean Protocol contracts are deployed to:

- [subgraph.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql)
- [subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql)
- [subgraph.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql)

## üß∂ Example Queries

**All pools**

```graphql
{
  pools(orderBy: oceanReserve, orderDirection: desc) {
    consumePrice
    datatokenReserve
    oceanReserve
    spotPrice
    swapFee
    transactionCount
  }
}
```

**All datatokens**

```graphql
{
  datatokens(orderBy: createTime, orderDirection: desc) {
    address
    symbol
    name
    cap
    supply
    publisher
    holderCount
  }
}
```

**All pool transactions for a given user**

```graphql
{
  poolTransactions(
    where: { userAddressStr: $userAddress }
    orderBy: timestamp
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    poolAddressStr
  }
}
```

> Note: all ETH addresses like `$userAddress` in above example need to be passed in lowercase.

## ü¶ë Development

First, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/
cd ocean-subgraph
npm i
```

Developing and testing any change requires them to be deployed against a locally running graph-node and some other components running in Docker. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine, then prepare the Docker setup:

```bash
cd docker
./setup.sh
```

Then add your Infura key as environment variable with a `.env` file, and start everything up with Docker Compose:

```bash
# create .env and modify
cp .env.example .env

docker-compose --env-file .env up
```

The default network for development is set to Rinkeby. If you want to switch to another network you have to modify the `docker/docker-compose.yml` file within `environment.ethereum`.

You now have a local graph-node running and can start deploying your changes to it. To do so, follow the [Deployment instructions](#Ô∏è-deployment).


## ü¶ë Development on Barge


1. Clone [barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) and run it in another terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge.git
cd barge
./start_ocean.sh --with-thegraph
```

If you have cloned Barge previously, make sure you are using the latest version by running `git pull`.

2. Switch back to your main terminal and clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/
cd ocean-subgraph
npm i
```

3. Let the components know where to pickup the smart contract addresses:
```
export ADDRESS_FILE="${HOME}/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json"
```

4. Generate the subgraph
```bash
npm run bargesetup
```

5. To deploy a subgraph connected to Barge, use:

```bash
npm run create:local-barge
npm run deploy:local-barge
```

- Alternatively, if you want to get the sub-graph quickly running on barge, you can run `npm run quickstart:barge` which combines steps 3-5 above.

You now have a local graph-node running on http://localhost:9000



## üß™ Testing

- Please note: the `npm run test` command is currently not working due to [this issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts/issues/113).

To run the integration tests locally, first start up barge by following the instructions above, then run the following terminal commands from the ocean-subgraph folder: 

```Bash
export ADDRESS_FILE="${HOME}/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json"
npm run test-integration
```

## ‚ú® Code Style

For linting and auto-formatting you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# lint all js with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all js & css with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## üõ≥ Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's 
machine with release scripts. From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping 
the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger Travis to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Deployment

Do the following to deploy the ocean-subgraph to a graph-node running locally, pointed against `mainnet`:

```bash
npm run codegen

# deploy
npm run create:local
npm run deploy:local
```

To deploy a subgraph connected to Rinkeby or Ropsten test networks, use instead:

```bash
# Rinkeby
npm run create:local-rinkeby
npm run deploy:local-rinkeby

# Ropsten
npm run create:local-ropsten
npm run deploy:local-ropsten
```

You can edit the event handler code and then run `npm run deploy:local`, with some caveats:

- Running deploy will fail if the code has no changes
- Sometimes deploy will fail no matter what, in this case:
  - Stop the docker-compose run (`docker-compose down` or Ctrl+C)
      This should stop the graph-node, ipfs and postgres containers
  - Delete the `ipfs` and `postgres` folders in `/docker/data` (`rm -rf ./docker/data/*`)
  - Run `docker-compose up` to restart graph-node, ipfs and postgres
  - Run `npm run create:local` to create the ocean-subgraph
  - Run `npm run deploy:local` to deploy the ocean-subgraph

> To deploy to one of the remote nodes run by Ocean, you can do port-forwarding and the above `:local` commands will work as is.
