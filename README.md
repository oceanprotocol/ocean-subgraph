## üèÑ Get Started

This subgraph is deployed for all networks the Ocean Protocol contracts are deployed to:

- [subgraph.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com)
- [subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com)
- [subgraph.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com](https://subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com)

## üß∂ Example Queries

**All pools**

```graphql
{
  pools(orderBy: oceanReserve, orderDirection: desc) {
    consumePrice
    datatokenReserve
    oceanReserve
    spotPrice
    swapFee
    transactionCount
  }
}
```

**All datatokens**

```graphql
{
  datatokens(orderBy: createTime, orderDirection: desc) {
    address
    symbol
    name
    cap
    supply
    publisher
    holderCount
  }
}
```

**All pool transactions for a given user**

```graphql
{
  poolTransactions(
    where: { userAddressStr: $userAddress }
    orderBy: timestamp
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    poolAddressStr
  }
}
```

> Note: all ETH addresses like `$userAddress` in above example need to be passed in lowercase.

## ü¶ë Development

Prepare the docker setup:
```bash
cd docker
./setup.sh
```
Edit docker-compose and add your infura key & network

Start :
```bash
docker-compose up
```
To use with ifura key create a .env file (look at .env.example)
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env up
```

Switch to a new terminal:

To deploy the ocean-subgraph to graph-node, see the `Deployment` section below.

You can make changes to the event handlers and/or features and re-deploy, again see the `Deployment` section below.

## ‚ú® Code Style

For linting and auto-formatting you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# lint all js with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all js & css with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's 
machine with release scripts. From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping 
the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger Travis to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)

## üõ≥ Production

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Deployment
- Do the following to deploy the ocean-subgraph to a graph-node running locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/
cd ocean-subgraph
npm i
npm run codegen
npm run create:local
npm run deploy:local
```

The above will deploy ocean-subgraph connecting to mainnet. To create/deploy subgraph connecting to Rinkeby or Ropsten test net, 
use :local-rinkeby or :local-ropsten with either create or deploy command.

- You can edit the event handler code and then run `npm run deploy:local`
  - Running deploy will fail if the code has no changes
  - Sometimes deploy will fail no matter what, in this case:
    - Stop the docker-compose run (`docker-compose down` or Ctrl+C)
      This should stop the graph-node, ipfs and postgres containers
    - Delete the `ipfs` and `postgres` folders in `/docker/data` (`rm -rf ./docker/data/*`)
    - Run `docker-compose up` to restart graph-node, ipfs and postgres
    - Run `npm run create:local` to create the ocean-subgraph
    - Run `npm run deploy:local` to deploy the ocean-subgraph

Note: to deploy to one of the remote nodes run by Ocean,  you can do port-forwarding then using the 
above `local` create/deploy commands will work as is.
