## üèÑ Get Started

This subgraph is deployed under `/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/` namespace for all networks the Ocean Protocol contracts are deployed to:

- [v4.subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com](https://v4.subgraph.ropsten.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql)
- [v4.subgraph.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com](https://v4.subgraph.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql)
- [v4.subgraph.mumbai.oceanprotocol.com](https://v4.subgraph.mumbai.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql)
- [v4.subgraph.moonbase.oceanprotocol.com](https://v4.subgraph.moonbase.oceanprotocol.com/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql)

## ‚õµ Example Queries

**All pools**

```graphql
{
  pools(orderBy: baseTokenLiquidity, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    datatoken {
      address
    }
    baseToken {
      symbol
    }
    baseTokenLiquidity
    datatokenLiquidity
  }
}
```

**Pools with the highest liquidity**

```graphql
{
  pools(where: {datatokenLiquidity_gte: 1}, orderBy: baseTokenLiquidity, orderDirection: desc, first: 15) {
    id
    datatoken {
      address
    }
    baseToken {
      symbol
    }
    baseTokenLiquidity
    datatokenLiquidity
  }
}
```

**All Data NFTs**

```graphql
{
  nfts(orderBy: createdTimestamp, orderDirection: desc){
    id,
    symbol,
    name,
    creator,
    createdTimestamp
  }
}
```

**All pool transactions for a given user**

```graphql
{
    poolTransactions(
      orderBy: timestamp
      orderDirection: desc
      where: { user: $user }
      first: 1000
    ) {
      baseToken {
        symbol
        address
      }
      baseTokenValue
      datatoken {
        symbol
        address
      }
      datatokenValue
      type
      tx
      timestamp
      pool {
        datatoken {
          id
        }
        id
      }
    }
  }
```

> Note: all ETH addresses like `$user` in above example need to be passed as a lowercase string.

**All pool transactions for a given user in an individual pool**

```graphql
{
    poolTransactions(
      orderBy: timestamp
      orderDirection: desc
      where: { pool: $pool, user: $user }
      first: 1000
    ) {
      baseToken {
        symbol
        address
      }
      baseTokenValue
      datatoken {
        symbol
        address
      }
      datatokenValue
      type
      tx
      timestamp
      pool {
        datatoken {
          id
        }
        id
      }
    }
  }
```

## üèä Development on Barge


1. Clone [barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) and run it in another terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge.git
cd barge
./start_ocean.sh --with-thegraph
```

If you have cloned Barge previously, make sure you are using the latest version by running `git pull`.

2. Switch back to your main terminal and clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/
cd ocean-subgraph
npm i
```

3. Let the components know where to pickup the smart contract addresses. 
```
export ADDRESS_FILE="${HOME}/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json"
```

4. Generate the subgraphs
```bash
node ./scripts/generatenetworkssubgraphs.js barge
npm run codegen
```

5. To deploy a subgraph use:

npm run create:local-barge
npm run deploy:local-barge

```bash
npm run create:local
npm run deploy:local
```

- Alternatively, if you want to get the sub-graph quickly running on barge, you can run `npm run quickstart:barge` which combines steps 4-5 above.

You now have a local graph-node running on http://127.0.0.1:9000/subgraphs/name/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/graphql


## üèä Deploying graphs for live networks


1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/
cd ocean-subgraph
npm i
```

2. Generate & deploy on rinkeby
```bash
npm run quickstart:rinkeby
```


## üîç Testing

- Please note: the `npm run test` command is currently not working due to [this issue](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts/issues/113).

To run the integration tests locally, first start up barge by following the instructions above, then run the following terminal commands from the ocean-subgraph folder: 

```Bash
export ADDRESS_FILE="${HOME}/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json"
npm run test-integration
```

## ‚ú® Code Style

For linting and auto-formatting you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# lint all js with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all js & css with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## üõ≥ Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's 
machine with release scripts. From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping 
the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger Travis to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Deployment

Do the following to deploy the ocean-subgraph to a graph-node running locally, pointed against `mainnet`:

```bash
npm run codegen

# deploy
npm run create:local
npm run deploy:local
```

To deploy a subgraph connected to Rinkeby or Ropsten test networks, use instead:

```bash
# Rinkeby
npm run create:local-rinkeby
npm run deploy:local-rinkeby

# Ropsten
npm run create:local-ropsten
npm run deploy:local-ropsten
```

You can edit the event handler code and then run `npm run deploy:local`, with some caveats:

- Running deploy will fail if the code has no changes
- Sometimes deploy will fail no matter what, in this case:
  - Stop the docker-compose run (`docker-compose down` or Ctrl+C)
      This should stop the graph-node, ipfs and postgres containers
  - Delete the `ipfs` and `postgres` folders in `/docker/data` (`rm -rf ./docker/data/*`)
  - Run `docker-compose up` to restart graph-node, ipfs and postgres
  - Run `npm run create:local` to create the ocean-subgraph
  - Run `npm run deploy:local` to deploy the ocean-subgraph

> To deploy to one of the remote nodes run by Ocean, you can do port-forwarding and the above `:local` commands will work as is.
